# Fabric

In this repo you can find all my ongoing work on Hyperledger Fabric.

In the tutorials folder I have prepared a simple network creation tutorial based on the first network sample provided by Hyperledger Fabric. 

The trial network folder is instead a modified version of the same sample. It was created with the goal of enabling an easier creation of a functional custom network. It is supposed to be pasted into your fabric-samples directory for it to work properly.
