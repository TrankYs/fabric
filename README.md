# Fabric

In this repo you can find all my ongoing work on Hyperledger Fabric.

In the tutorials folder I have prepared a simple network creation tutorial based on the byfn example provided by Hyperledger Fabric. 

The trial network folder is supposed to be pasted into your fabric-samples directory for it to work properly.
